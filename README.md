this would be my note of my learning
- **dont forget**, exported component need to be start with capital letter!!
- use `go get -u <module_name>` to get and update module in `go.mod`
- most code come from [mikelopster's tutorial](https://docs.mikelopster.dev/c/goapi-essential/chapter-3/crud). I'll try to extend it for my own variant(for learning)
